## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this challenge, I improved my CSS flexbox skills, better understood how to align and structure content efficiently, and refined my ability to center elements both horizontally and vertically.

Additionally, I learned how to import Google Fonts directly into my HTML files without downloading them. Here’s an example:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

This allows me to apply fonts in my CSS like this:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued Development

I want to improve my research skills in programming. Since I am still new to programming, I often struggle with knowing what to search for when I run into issues. I believe that improving my ability to browse the web effectively—knowing what keywords to use, which websites to check, and how to identify useful information—will be key to becoming a better developer.

### Useful Resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Helped me troubleshoot issues and find quick solutions.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great reference for HTML and CSS concepts.
- [Dani Krossing's YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaniKrossing) - I specifically watched his tutorial on **"How to Import New Fonts Using HTML."**
